# Chess Game I

**AI â€“ Problem #22**

`http://www.microcontest.com/contest.php?id=22&lang=en`


## Description

Your objective is to control all of the chessboard boxes with a limited number
of pieces. The variable pieces gives you a list of the pieces you have.

For example, it may contain `dttfcp`. In this case you have a queen, two rooks,
a bishop, a knight, and a pawn.

All the pieces move in the traditional way except the pawn which can move one
square according to the four diagonals.

You must therefore find a positioning such that all the squares are under
attack.

There is one variable per part to return: its name corresponds to its position
in the list. In the previous example, the queen is in first position, so the
variable will be called `1`. This contains the index of the box on which the
piece is located:

Let's take a concrete example. If variable pieces contains `dddttcc`, there are
three queens, two rooks, and two knights. Here is a possible solution:

The variables to return in this case would be:

```text
'1' = 2
'2' = 9
'3' = 16
'4' = 31
'5' = 59
'6' = 43
'7' = 29
```
